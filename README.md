# The Complete Node.js Developer Course
## About
I'm learning NodeJS with "The Complete Node.js Developer Course", taught by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
### What is and Why should I use Node.js?
Following the definition of Wikipedia:
> Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google's V8 Javascript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in Javascript.

During the lesson, Andrew talked about that NodeJS isn't a Javascript Framework but instead a Runtime Environment based on Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine. The differences between blocking and non-blocking assignments is also clarified, let me give a brief resume about it.
#### Blocking
A Blocking operation is where further execution is impeded to be finished until the operation that came before be finished. 
#### Non-Blocking
Non-Blocking operation it's the opposite. While blocking prevents the operation, the non-blocking let all the operation pass and use them according the demand.
